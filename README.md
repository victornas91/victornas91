15+ years working with IT, mainly support, infrastructure and as an ESL for brazilians. Now also 5+ years as a Public Sector Agent that started as an Adm Agent, now an IT Manager that oversees operations related to more than 3000 people.

I'm also a generalist Software and Hardware Developer that uses Python, C#, ESP32, PLC and SQL as tools to architect systems that uses all of these technologies together, integrating projects with Cloud Computing (AWS and Azure) and Machine Learning and focused on fields such as Mechatronics, Aerospace, Big Data, Physics, Infosec, IT Infrastructure, Mobile / 3D Web Apps and Games.

Some of the integrated projects I'm developing right now as hobby / services and am planning to showcase on my Youtube channel (@victornas91):

- Local LLM tuning / training
- AI Agents development for Web Scraping and Social Network automation
- Data Analysis for IoT and PLC devices
- Machine Vision for Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics
- AI training for Games
- Algo Trading
- 3D Web Apps Development, Voxels and Low-Poly 3D Modeling and Sculpting
- Mobile Apps, including for Android Auto
- PLC and IoT programming
- 3D Desktop and Mobile Games with Unity
- Custom IT Infrastructure tools
- AWS and Azure Cloud Engineering projects including CI / CD automation
- FinOps for Cloud for resources optimization
- Electromagnetism, Optics and Semiconductor Physics using IoT for demonstration or Unity for 3D visualization
- Pentesting "on demand"; Intel Gathering; Reverse Engineering and Security of Mobile Apps
- Additive Manufacture tools design
- Procedural Generation tools development for 3D modeling of devices parts
- Computer Simulation tools development
